# FRC 2714 Offseason Projects
All the 2019 Offseason robot experiments, ideas, and concepts are placed in this repository. 

## Possible TODOs 
* Create the modular "BBQ Libs" package that can be added onto any codebase to instantly add custom support. (Possibly gradle?)
* Research and create a well furnished swerve driving controller for manual input and trajectory tracking.
